Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Classification with deep learning (DeepDISC) is a framework built on `detectron2 <https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ that identifies, deblends, and performs other tasks on objects in astronomical images.  Using state-of-the-art models available in detectron2, DeepDISC can be applied to classify stars/galaxies, estimate redshifts, and more. This code was developed as part of a LINCC Frameworks Incubator.
